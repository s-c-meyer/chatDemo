# Meyer's Messages ðŸ“±ðŸ“¨

This is a chat app that was built using React Native and tested using an Android Emulator and my iPhone. The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share their location and share images. Images may be shared either from the devices media library, or directly from the camera within the app.
